# Description: 

This repo contains an index.html file and associated assets for Horiseon's website. The website is designed to prioritze accessability and readability with bright and high contrast content boxes and a nav bar at the top that will scroll to the proper section. 

My contribution to this project was properly commenting the css file, replacing a number of div tags with more descriptive semantic tags, adding alt tags to images, adding a universal selector to reset padding and margins, and condensing classes in css to reduce redundancy. I also had to switch the "search engne optimization" tag from a class to an id in order for the nav bar to be able to properly scroll to that section.
